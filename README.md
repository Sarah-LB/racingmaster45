        -   The three main colours used are red, black and white.  These were chosen by Racing Master 45 and are the colours of his brand.
        -   The Inter font is the main font used throughout the whole website with sans serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Inter is a clean and clear font that is easy to read.  Bruno Ace font is used for headings with cursive as the fallback.  This is also a clean and clear font but with a modern and edgy style.
